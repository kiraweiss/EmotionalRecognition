Coding Style Document


We used four different languages for our web application. First, we used python in a
jupyter notebook in order to train our model. Next, we used Javascript to code our 
front-end functionality, and access the Spotify API. In order to integrate our model,
into the Web App we used python, and finally, we used HTML/CSS for the
visible aspects of our interface. Below, we will go through how we named our variables 
and functions, comments, whitespaces, indentation, capitalization, and characters per 
line for each of these different languages.
