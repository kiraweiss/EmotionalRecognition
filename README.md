# Emotional Recognition

Our Web Application will recommend Spotify playlists for users based on their mood. The application will allow the user to upload a selfie and then using that image, a Machine Learning Model will categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in to one of four categories (Angry, Happy, Sad, Surprised). Once the emotion is determined, the application will use the Spotify API to recommend music playlists to match that mood.
